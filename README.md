# Air-Quality-Index

In this Project, We tried solving Air Quality Index problem. The dataset used is created by collecting
data like gas densities at different locations in India and calculating their AQI individually. Using this
dataset, we intended to predict Air Quality Index for various location where the density of gases are
available and based on that it can decided whether it needs improvement or not. We used some machine
learning methods, including Linear, ridge and lasso regression, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), decision
tree, random forest, stacking ensemble, and support vector machine (SVM), to forecast various levels
of pollutants using air quality index (AQI). A series of experiments, using datasets for five different
cities in India are obtained to get the best prediction performance. Among all the regression models, it
is found that random forest gave best R2 score.
